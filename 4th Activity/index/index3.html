																																																					                    However, there is one music group that I have listened to off and on for a very long time. 
																																																										                    This group is Blue October, and I have listened to them since I was six years old when my mother first introduced me. 
																																																															                    The music from Blue October  is ever changing and has been linear to my ever changing life. 
																																																																				                    I love the music that they make because it is real and alive. 
																																																																									                    I look for sincear songs; Blue October meets this expectation that I have. 
																																																																														                    The song "Into The Ocean" is the first song that I had ever heard by them. </td>
