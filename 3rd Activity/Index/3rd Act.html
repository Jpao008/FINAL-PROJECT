            Facebook is a platform where I can entertain myself. where I can share informations whether it is all about politics or not.

            Songs entirely runs to my head. Spotify is one of my favorite website as it provides new songs, albums and even reviving 
            old hits. I enjoy listening to it and apply it as I play ukelele. It is a great website where I can  unleash my talent in 
            playing different kinds of intruments. Applying it to my performance as well as I play with a band.

            Entertaining myself is one of the key how I enjoy my free time. Youtube is a great way for me to relax and also stay informed. 
            Watching quality videos with a discovery of knowledge is important to me. It helps me to understand some topics that I wanted 
            to solve. It helps me to unravel my curiosity when it comes to the things  that I eager to learn.

            Google mail is the website I frequently used. It helps me to communicate with my instructors. As well as helping me to the online 
            class set up amid pandemic. I used it also as a tool of communication to my classmates because it is easy to send some files 
            that we will be needing. I also used this for verifying my goole account when I am signing up to the other websites.

            Instagram is a cool platform where I can edit and post my pictures like on facebook. I like also to watch some reels on this 
            website. It shows the lifestyle of the influencers that I've been following. It gives me an idea on how I would show my 
            appreciation for the things I want to do. It is easy to use, just double tap a photo you want, write comments about the posts 
            that you've seen and you can even share the pictures as your story.
